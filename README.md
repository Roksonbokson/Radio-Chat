# Radio-Chat

**Overview**

Radio Chat is a combination of tools and procedures required to merge radio channel communication with Rocket.Chat.
In the public security sector (Police, Firefighters, Medical Emergency etc.), during interventions, many traditional parallel communication channels (radio, phone, video) are used. In addition to these old channels, modern chat services are also being used. This solution integrates radio into Rocket.Chat. This way all radio communication will be recorded in the appropriate Rocket.Chat channel for all concerned to listen when they can (in case they were occupied during the time the transmission took place), mixed with any relevant chat communication. Voice messages are also transcripted into chat for transparency.

**Used applications:**

- Snooper (https://www.snooper.se/)
On a windows computer, we run an application called Snooper, a voice-activated recorder. When the volume of the audio is higher than the set limit, the recorder activates and keeps recording until the volume drops below that limit. After the recording stops, a script is executed that uploads created recording to the selected group. A hard copy of the recorded file stays on the local computer.

- Rocket.chat app - SpeechToText
For transcript of audio files in rocket.chat

- VHF bot(rocket.chat bot)
VHF bot(rocket.chat bot) is an application that downloads and plays audio files generated by users in rocket.chat. Bot scans the channel when the audio file is uploaded, bot downloads it and plays it automatically.
