# Radio-Chat

**Used applications:**

- Snooper (https://www.snooper.se/)
On a windows computer, we run an application called Snooper, a voice-activated recorder. When the volume of the audio is higher than the set limit, the recorder activates and keeps recording until the volume drops below that limit. After the recording stops, a script is executed that uploads created recording to the selected group. A hard copy of the recorded file stays on the local computer.

Upload script content:

- Rocket.chat app - SpeechToText
For transcript of audio files in rocket.chat

- VHF bot(rocket.chat bot)
VHF bot(rocket.chat bot) is an application that downloads and plays audio files generated by users in rocket.chat. Bot scans the channel when the audio file is uploaded, bot downloads it and plays it automatically.
